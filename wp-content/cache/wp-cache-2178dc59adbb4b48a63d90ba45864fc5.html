				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Bicknell's Thrush by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/9076911053/"><img alt="Bicknell's Thrush" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2812/9076911053_308bed1df9.jpg" width="500" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>On June 15, 1881, an amateur ornithologist named Eugene P. Bicknell noticed what looked and sounded like a Gray-cheeked Thrush singing near the summit of Slide Mountain in New York’s Catskill range, way, way south of the Gray-cheeked Thrush’s breeding range on the tundra. So he did what bird aficionados were wont to do at the time—he shot that bird and another one to compare the two little corpses with other dead thrushes in his collection. That made him certain that they were Gray-cheeked Thrushes, though because of some differences in appearance and their song, and because they were so far from the normal breeding range of the species, he thought they might be a different subspecies. To confirm this, he sent them and the rest of his Gray-cheeked Thrush specimens to Robert Ridgway at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Ridgeway agreed that the New York birds were a previously undiscovered subspecies of Gray-cheeked Thrush, and named the population for Bicknell.</p>
<p>Other ornithologists were intrigued with this isolated population and started studying it. The breeding and wintering ranges were entirely different for the two populations—The Gray-cheeked Thrush nests in taiga and tundra habitat from Newfoundland to eastern Siberia and winters in eastern South America while Bicknell’s Thrush nests in mountains of eastern New York and New England up to southeastern Canada, and winters in the Greater Antilles, especially on Hispaniola. Further research established that significant differences in body structure, DNA, and song between the two populations were great enough to list them as separate species, and the American Ornithologists Union officially separated Bicknell’s Thrush into a separate species in 1995.</p>
<p>Bicknell’s Thrush is unique among the thrushes for having a mating system called female-defense polygynandry, in which both males and females may breed with more than one partner, but most often—that is, in about 75% of all nests—one female and her nestlings are attended by 2-4 males. Males sing from a variety of posts within their home range, but don’t defend a territory. It’s females who aggressively defend their nesting territory against other females. Males significantly outnumber females, though it’s not known if male hatchlings outnumber females or if there is different mortality and why. It’s possible that Gray-cheeked Thrushes also exhibit some of these quirks—their nesting grounds are so remote that few people have studied them in any detail, especially because up until 1995, people thought that Bicknell’s and Gray-cheeks were the same species, so believed that the information gathered for Bicknell’s Thrush applied to Gray-cheeked Thrush as well.</p>
<p>On June 17, I was lucky enough to hear and then get a good if fleeting look at Bicknell’s Thrush in New Hampshire. On 6 dates this June, the Mt. Washington Auto Road provided a van tour bringing people up to see this fascinating bird. I was a little surprised that the tour leader used recordings to draw in the bird. She said they’ve become habituated to the recordings and don’t always respond, but I find it terribly troubling that they use recordings at all just to gratify birders’ lust for the list. Bicknell’s Thrush is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and is considered one of the most rare, range-restricted breeding species in eastern North America, and its population is known to be declining, but because of the politically-influenced bureaucratic difficulties in listing even the most vulnerable birds for protections under the Endangered Species Act, it isn’t illegal to disturb Bicknell’s Thrush on private property, which the Auto Road is. It felt uncomfortably weird, though, just a week after going on a Kirtland’s Warbler tour in Michigan in which our wonderful guide worked hard to help us all see the bird without using any recordings at all, to encounter such a different philosophy in pursuing a bird equally worthy of every protection. It didn’t keep me from adding Bicknell’s Thrush to my lifelist, especially because we were hearing it before the recording was played, but that little tick on my lifelist will always seem a little troubling and tainted.</p>
<p>Mia Revels used recordings to bring in the Swainson’s Warbler I saw in southeastern Oklahoma during the Red Slough birding festival, but as the primary researcher studying the species in Oklahoma, she knew exactly where a bird would be, and played the song only briefly, anticipating based on her long experience where it would alight so we’d all get a look and then leave it alone. I feel vastly different about the judgments and techniques of the experts working tirelessly to study and conserve a species than I do about a for-profit company whose only interest in a species is the money they’ll get from showing it to people.</p>
<p>I’ve personally used recordings occasionally, and been with people who use them, to call in fairly common species in lightly-birded areas, though I do this very seldom and find the practice more and more unpalatable. The Mt. Washington Auto Road is well known among birders as a place to easily see Bicknell’s Thrush, and I’m sure too many people are using recordings as it is—this should not be done so cavalierly for profit. I know this is inconsistent and maybe unfair of me, but that’s my take.</p>

<p>From June 6—23, I took a trip to New England. The ultimate goals were to add the endangered Bicknell’s Thrush of the Adirondack Mountains and the Atlantic Puffin and some other northern seabirds to my Conservation Big Year list, but I made plenty of other stops along the way, adding splendid birds and lovely memories.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a title="Troy Walters and his education Northern Saw-whet Owl at Trees for Tomorrow by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/9142190729/"><img alt="Troy Walters and his education Northern Saw-whet Owl at Trees for Tomorrow" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7441/9142190729_4bce27dbe2.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Troy Walters and his education Northern Saw-whet Owl at Trees for Tomorrow</p></div>

I wonder how many individuals we&#8217;ve seen, and how many times one bird has returned year after year?</p></div>
<p>My first major stop was Grayling, Michigan, to see Kirtland’s Warbler, but I broke up that 500-mile drive with a stop in Eagle River, Wisconsin. For the past decade or so, I’ve taught an Elderhostel, or now Road Scholar, class at Trees for Tomorrow there. This year for the first time we didn’t get enough people to hold the class, but I really missed birding with Troy Walters, the amazing naturalist who scouts the area and is my co-leader, so the first night out, I crashed on his sofa and we did some early morning birding together. So far my nemesis bird of the year seems to be the Spruce Grouse. Troy brought me to his favorite spots for seeing them, but we missed it. I didn’t mind—it was lovely being back in that part of northern Wisconsin, and birding with Troy is one of the fun rituals of my year.</p>

He&#8217;s headed toward the left.</p></div>
<p>After the warbler, I headed on to Ohio. But when I was looking at a map in a Michigan rest area along the way, I noticed that the Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge was not far out of my way. This was an occasional field trip destination for both of my college ornithology classes, at which I’d added several lifers, so I decided to go there and drive the wildlife loop. I got my first Grasshopper Sparrow of the year there, and had a lovely experience watching Black Terns. I saw a lot of Black Terns back in the 70s, but their numbers have dwindled dangerously. They were darting about too quickly, in poor light, for me to get any quality photos, but I didn’t even mind—I parked myself where a small group of them was fishing and felt deeply happy just watching them.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a title="Grasshopper Sparrow by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/9015795224/"><img alt="Grasshopper Sparrow" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7298/9015795224_f6719b09bd.jpg" width="500" height="342" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Grasshopper Sparrow</p></div>
<p>Then it was on to Ohio, to the Black Swamp Bird Observatory’s famous Magee Marsh. I spent one rainy morning birding with my friend Ryan Lesniewicz—we had great looks and photos of a Grasshopper Sparrow and heard my first Henslow’s Sparrow of the year.</p>
<p><a title="Yellow Warbler by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/9002392223/"><img alt="Yellow Warbler" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7419/9002392223_75c8004843.jpg" width="500" height="351" /></a></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a title="Yellow-billed Cuckoo by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/9040749165/"><img alt="Yellow-billed Cuckoo" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7433/9040749165_c29fd6135b.jpg" width="500" height="362" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yellow-billed Cuckoo at Magee Marsh</p></div>
<p>The birding in the Magee Marsh was superb. This is a major destination of birders during spring migration, when warblers can be amazingly dense. Birders from all over the world gather on the boardwalk by the thousands to watch the spectacle. Now the birders and migrating birds were gone, but the remaining local birds are so accustomed to people on the boardwalk that they go about their daily business without hiding from view at all. I spent many minutes watching one male Yellow Warbler at very close range. He was tucked into a dense shrub, but there was just enough of a leaf gap for me to watch him preening, looking about, and singing. Every now and then he’d look directly at me, but was apparently so habituated to the sounds of camera shutters clicking away and people gawking at him that he didn’t seem to mind my presence at all.</p>

<p>Further down, some children joyfully alerted me to a female Yellow Warbler on her nest, built right at their eye level. She had two tiny chicks beneath her, but I only got a glimpse of them that day. I returned the next to get lots of photos of her feeding them. Again, she was very calm while being watched because of how well used this boardwalk is.</p>

<p>That evening I had a lovely dinner with field guide authors and my hero conservationists and educators, Kenn and Kimberly Kaufman. Afterward, I headed to my good friend Paula Lozano’s house in Cleveland. (I am so desperately geographically impaired that every time I go there, Paula has to come out to her front yard to show me which is her house. Every friggin&#8217; time!)</p>

<p>Next morning, Paula brought me to a cemetery where a colony of Bank Swallows were nesting, and then to a lovely field in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park where we heard another Henslow’s Sparrow and feasted on the beauty of Bobolinks everywhere.</p>
<p><a title="Great Blue Heron family in Sapsucker Woods by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/9145749014/"><img alt="Great Blue Heron family in Sapsucker Woods" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2825/9145749014_8b907b4a71.jpg" width="500" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>Next day I drove to Ithaca, New York, to see my beloved Great Blue Herons and visit my beloved Cornell Lab of Ornithology. I’m trying to highlight birds of conservation interest this year, and also the institutions and people doing the research, education, and conservation projects to help them. My stops along the way to New England fit the bill perfectly.</p>
<p>I left Ithaca with my year list at 437.</p>

<p>One of the best things about doing my Conservation Big Year is looking at birds I’ve already seen a dozen times or more, yet somehow not nearly enough, such as Kirtland’s Warbler. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/9133542783/" title="Me looking at my lifer Kirtland's Warbler by Laura Erickson, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7439/9133542783_15c110bddf.jpg" width="500" height="344" alt="Me looking at my lifer Kirtland's Warbler"></a></p>
<p>I saw my first one ever on June 6, 1976. That year marked the nation’s Bicentennial, and Kirtland’s Warbler was officially named Michigan’s Bicentennial Bird. At the time it was critically endangered—only 167 singing males were found two years before, in 1974. The people protecting it were trying to get the population up to 200 by the Bicentennial, which they just barely succeeded in doing. This rarest warbler on the continent was in dire trouble. Fortunately, that was right after the Endangered Species Act kicked in, and the combination of research into the causes of the species’ imperilment and management to maintain essential habitat and remove Brown-headed Cowbirds turned the trend around. Last year, 2012, the species count reached an all-time high of 2063 in Michigan alone, and now the species has spread a bit into Wisconsin and Ontario. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/7185574756/" title="Female Kirtland's Warbler at Magee Marsh by Laura Erickson, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7245/7185574756_63af2cfb25.jpg" width="500" height="366" alt="Female Kirtland's Warbler at Magee Marsh"></a></p>
<p>Since 1976, I’ve seen Kirtland’s Warbler on several other occasions. I brought my whole family to see Kirtland’s Warbler 20 years ago en route on a family vacation in New England, but even though the population was fairly high at that point, it was late in the nesting cycle, when males were too busy feeding young to be out where anyone could see them. The northern route between Duluth and Oberlin, Ohio, where our daughter went to school, went right past Grayling, so Russ and I stopped a few times. And I’ve been lucky enough to see Kirtland’s Warblers a couple of times during spring migration at Magee Marsh at the Black Swamp Bird Observatory in Ohio, and once during fall migration at Lake Kissimmee State Park in Florida. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/5773949813/" title="Kirtland's Warbler by Laura Erickson, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3591/5773949813_595a7575b6.jpg" width="500" height="387" alt="Kirtland's Warbler"></a></p>
<p>This year, first thing in the morning on June 8, I went on a guided trip in Grayling, Michigan, sponsored by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and Michigan Audubon Society, to see the warblers. These well advertised trips make it easy for anyone to see this endangered species without putting pressure on the birds during their vulnerable breeding season. The birds had been back for well over a week—some more than two weeks—so most of the territorial boundaries had been settled and pairs were getting down to incubating eggs or even raising nestlings. Males were still singing fairly vigorously but usually staying hunkered down rather than perching conspicuously atop the trees. We heard quite a few on our tour, but managed halfway decent looks at only one male, and needed a spotting scope to see him well. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/8991606498/" title="Kirtland's Warbler by Laura Erickson, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8121/8991606498_10bf4b07fc.jpg" width="500" height="325" alt="Kirtland's Warbler"></a></p>
<p>After the tour, I spotted one male singing atop a tree right next to a major highway, so I got some good photos of him, and went to another spot later that day and the next morning where I could hunker down in hopes that other males would venture close enough for photography. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/9135986154/" title="Kirtland's Warbler trip 2013--our expert leader at far left, and people photographing a Vesper Sparrow nest on the ground just to the right. by Laura Erickson, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5341/9135986154_0d484520fd.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kirtland's Warbler trip 2013--our expert leader at far left, and people photographing a Vesper Sparrow nest on the ground just to the right."></a></p>
<p>Because Kirtland’s Warbler is endangered, we were legally required to stay on paths and roads, off the actual nesting habitat, but I never walk off paths anyway—I’m petrified of stepping on a bird, toad, insect, or other tiny creature without realizing it. On our guided walk, a Vesper Sparrow suddenly darted through our group and I knew we’d passed her nest. Sure enough, just inches from the path was a beautiful nest, tucked deep into the weeds. A footstep to the side of the path could have crushed the four tiny nestlings and none of us would have been the wiser. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/9045774780/" title="Vesper Sparrow nest by Laura Erickson, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7350/9045774780_8c400dc81d.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Vesper Sparrow nest"></a></p>
<p>Even though I always stay on paths and roads, I’m lucky and patient. A few Kirtland’s Warblers were nice and cooperative, so I got lots of photos, including some of one bird singing with a large caterpillar in his beak.</p>

<p>I made time for Kirtland’s Warblers this year only because of my Conservation Big Year, but ironically, had to leave after just a day and a half because of my Conservation Big Year—the next species were beckoning. I felt sad saying goodbye to this lovely, splendid bird, but happy to be leaving with photos, sound recordings, and wonderful memories.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I’ve grown busier and busier in recent years, and am spending more and more time traveling, I’ve let slide one of the loveliest and favorite of all my birding activities—taking long walks in Port Wing, Wisconsin. My normal route was about 7 miles, but I could shorten it to about 5 miles or add various detours along the way, bringing it up to as many as 12 miles. When I was in my 20s and 30s, I took these walks several times a year, but it dropped to only once or twice a year at most by the time I was in my 40s. And as far as I can remember, I didn’t take the walk a single time while I was in my 50s. But I decided this was one lovely tradition I wanted to revive during my Conservation Big Year, so I set out on June 3 to take a hike.</p>
<p><a title="Photon by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/3872990494/"><img alt="Photon" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2500/3872990494_d86de14d3b.jpg" width="500" height="358" /></a></p>
<p>My little dog Photon and I set out together about 5:30 am. Birding along Russ’s mom’s driveway wasn’t as satisfying as usual—no Alder Flycatchers, Sedge Wrens, Le Conte’s Sparrows, or even Savannah Sparrows serenaded us as we walked. I hope this was just because migration is so late this year, and that they’ll show up eventually, but the late mowing of that field last fall, combined with the late spring, means it probably won’t provide suitable habitat for ground-nesting birds this year. One snipe winnowed from overhead, a pair of Sandhill Cranes called from the distance, and a Ruffed Grouse drummed in the woods not too far from Russ’s mom’s house—that soft thumping was balm to my soul.</p>
<p><a title="Canada Warbler by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/8793340867/"><img alt="Canada Warbler" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3798/8793340867_38a74c97ac.jpg" width="500" height="318" /></a></p>
<p>Once we made it to Kinney Valley Road, I found a small group of migrants, including a Canada Warbler, but again, very few birds on territory. Leaf-out is late this year, and without leaves, there are no hatching caterpillars—the food that fuels warbler migration and feeds them as they arrive on territory. It was eerily quiet for a beautiful June morning, but a second grouse was drumming—a promising sign for one species at least. Photon is slowing down now that she’s 15, so she wasn’t running ahead and charging back as she used to, but she was holding up pretty well, checking out every odor along the way and holding her tail up at a jaunty angle.</p>
<p><a title="Le Conte's Sparrow by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/5876938413/"><img alt="Le Conte's Sparrow" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5315/5876938413_4f7a2e8be0.jpg" width="500" height="390" /></a></p>
<p>Along Highway 13 to the Quarry Road, I finally heard a Le Conte’s Sparrow—that was a most welcome addition to my Conservation Big Year. I was almost to the quarry before Russ drove up to rescue Photon—she’d walked over two miles and was starting to grow weary. She’s in good shape for her age, and I felt lucky I had her along that far. I’ve always done this walk with a dog—first my golden retriever Bunter and then Photon—so I felt bereft as she went off in the car, but it was impossible to stay sad as three Winter Wrens started singing—this particular stretch of Quarry Road has always been my best spot for hearing them. Several other birds were on territory here, including a lovely Solitary Vireo and a pair of Yellow-bellied Flycatchers that kindly provided long photo-ops. I saw a small migrating flock of warblers that included two late Wilson’s Warblers.</p>
<p><a title="Blue-headed Vireo by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/8950370990/"><img alt="Blue-headed Vireo" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5445/8950370990_0da047d6b3.jpg" width="500" height="364" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Yellow-bellied Flycatcher by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/8949191505/"><img alt="Yellow-bellied Flycatcher" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3704/8949191505_6372e7bbea.jpg" width="500" height="339" /></a></p>
<p>Next, I headed to the slough and the main beach. Barn Swallows twittered overhead as I watched an American Pipit and two gorgeous Dunlins on the beach—more late migrants.</p>
<p><a title="Barn Swallow by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/8949198843/"><img alt="Barn Swallow" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7319/8949198843_5d61f3543d.jpg" width="500" height="265" /></a></p>
<p><a title="American Pipit by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/8950402038/"><img alt="American Pipit" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3691/8950402038_21c23cc30c.jpg" width="500" height="342" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Dunlin by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/8950408130/"><img alt="Dunlin" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3770/8950408130_57818270cd.jpg" width="500" height="348" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Golden-crowned Kinglet by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/8949222829/"><img alt="Golden-crowned Kinglet" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7308/8949222829_ee9fc51340.jpg" width="500" height="351" /></a></p>
<p>Then I wended my way to my favorite spot on the planet, Big Pete Road. I had one unexpected new bird for the year—a Black-backed Woodpecker who called out to grab my attention but refused to pose for photos—and one expected one—a Golden-crowned Kinglet.</p>
<p><a title="Twin Falls by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/8949228373/"><img alt="Twin Falls" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5449/8949228373_cd2c84ff05.jpg" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="American Redstart by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/8949244573/"><img alt="American Redstart" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7338/8949244573_28901590a9.jpg" width="500" height="342" /></a></p>
<p>Twin Falls had more water than usual, and at the old sewage ponds, American Redstarts cooperated splendidly for photographs as large numbers of spring peepers and toads called. Even if the numbers of individual birds were low, I ended my long walk with 83 species, three of them new for my Conservation Big Year. I’m growing discouraged by the falling numbers of birds, but was filled with quiet joy at spending a day with so many lovely little survivors.</p>
<p><a title="Photon the Exhausted by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/3872226443/"><img alt="Photon the Exhausted" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2509/3872226443_3f6ccaa0ac.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This walk and the woodcocks I heard the evening before along my mother-in-law&#8217;s driveway bring my year list to 431. You can see <a href="http://www.conservationbigyear.com/conservation-big-year-official-list/">the list, with photos, here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Whimbrel by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/8896051542/"><img alt="Whimbrel" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2809/8896051542_32836e0075.jpg" width="500" height="347" /></a><br />
It&#8217;s the first of June, but it&#8217;s cold and murky here in Duluth today, and migration continues apace along the Lake Superior shoreline, especially at Wisconsin Point and Park Point. In the final two days of May I added five new species for the year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whimbrel (Park Point, May 30)</li>
<li>Yellow-bellied Flycatcher (Park Point, May 30)</li>
<li>Alder Flycatcher (my Mourning Dove Survey route, May 31)</li>
<li>Connecticut Warbler (Park Point, May 30)</li>
<li>Rusty Blackbird (Park Point, May 30)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was scared I was going to miss Rusty Blackbird altogether—I&#8217;ve missed it more years than I&#8217;ve seen it since about 2000, but this used to be one of those species that were almost impossible to miss during spring migration if you were paying the least bit of attention. If listing species hadn&#8217;t evolved into a political rather than scientific process, the Rusty Blackbird would most certainly be listed as &#8220;Threatened&#8221; or even &#8220;Endangered&#8221; after its dramatic population plummet. It&#8217;s declined 85–99 percent since I started birding!</p>
<p>I saw some Traill&#8217;s-type flycatchers on Park Point a few times during migration, including on Thursday, but even though they were almost certainly Alders, I didn&#8217;t count them until I could hear them sing yesterday. I virtually always count my First-Of-Year Alder Flycatchers either on my Mourning Dove route or at my mother-in-law&#8217;s place in Port Wing, Wisconsin.</p>
<p><a title="Common Nighthawk by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/7835664956/"><img alt="Common Nighthawk" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8289/7835664956_bfaf50e4cd.jpg" width="500" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>This coming Thursday I&#8217;m heading out east. I&#8217;ll be visiting my dear friend and colleague Troy Walters at <a href="http://www.treesfortomorrow.com">Trees for Tomorrow</a> Thursday night. We teach a &#8220;Road Scholar&#8221; birding class there every year (except this year—it was cancelled due to low numbers enrolled), and every year we go out one evening for Common Nighthawks and Whip-poor-wills (and sometimes American Woodcocks are still displaying). It just seems weird to get my first Whip-poor-wills of the year without Troy, so we&#8217;ll go to our traditional stomping grounds together Thursday (assuming the weather cooperates). And Friday morning we&#8217;ll go to some of his favorite boggy zones looking for Spruce Grouse and whatever else we can find.</p>
<p><a title="Kirtland's Warbler by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/5773949813/"><img alt="Kirtland's Warbler" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3591/5773949813_595a7575b6.jpg" width="500" height="387" /></a></p>
<p>Then I move on to Grayling, Michigan, to see Kirtland&#8217;s Warbler. I could find them on my own—they are loud singers with low enough tones that they&#8217;re well within my hearing range still, and it&#8217;s easy to pick them out along county roadsides, even while driving, now that they&#8217;ve become so much more common in their tiny range—but I can&#8217;t imagine skipping out on the <a href="http://www.michiganaudubon.org/kirtlandswarbler.html">US Fish and Wildlife Service guided tours sponsored by Michigan Audubon</a>. I&#8217;ve been on these tours at least five times now. It&#8217;s important to be counted among the tourists drawn to the area specifically to see this splendid bird, and I love seeing a whole new crop of energetic, knowledgeable young guides. These guides are paid by Michigan Audubon to lead the official tours for USF&amp;W—yet another excellent reason to support <a href="http://www.michiganaudubon.org">Michigan Audubon</a>!</p>
<p>After Grayling, I&#8217;m going to make a stop at the <a href="http://www.bsbobird.org">Black Swamp Bird Observatory</a>. Migration will most certainly have ended by then in the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Home/wild_resourcessubhomepage/WildlifeAreaMaps/NorthwestOhioWildlifeAreaMaps/MageeMarshWildlifeArea/tabid/19778/Default.aspx">Magee Marsh</a>, even during this bizarre year, but this is such a critical stopover point during migration that I can&#8217;t imagine doing a &#8220;Conservation Big Year&#8221; without visiting there at least once! I was sad to miss this year&#8217;s <a href="http://dev.biggestweekinamericanbirding.com/default.aspx">&#8220;Biggest Week in American Birding&#8221;</a>!</p>
<p><a title="Great Blue Heron by Laura Erickson, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraerickson/3703276538/"><img alt="Great Blue Heron" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2597/3703276538_f514fd23b3.jpg" width="500" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>From there I head on to my beloved <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/Page.aspx?pid=1478">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a> and &#8220;my&#8221; Great Blue Herons! Well, the male still seems like he&#8217;s &#8220;mine,&#8221; but this year he has a new mate. I get to peek in on them via <a href="http://cams.allaboutbirds.org/channel/8/GreatBlueHeron/">Cornell&#8217;s nest cam</a>, but how I&#8217;ve longed to see them up close and personal, in real life, again! And I have many dear human friends at Cornell I want to say hey to as well.</p>
<p>Then on to New York. Katie, Michael, and I will take a pleasant jaunt up to Long Island. They&#8217;ll be biking back while I take the ferry, headed up to New Hampshire&#8217;s Mt. Washington to see Bicknell&#8217;s Thrush. Like so many Neotropical migrants, this poor bird has had a <a href="http://www.adirondackavianexpeditions.com/climate-change/extreme-weather-events-and-climate-change">difficult spring</a>. Rather than pressing to see it on my own, I&#8217;m taking the June 17 <a href="http://mtwashingtonautoroad.com/guided-tours/bicknells-thrush-tours/">Bicknell&#8217;s Thrush Mt. Washington Auto Tour</a>. I tend to prefer finding birds on my own, but in the case of an endangered species, the birds&#8217; needs come first, and the fewer separate parties invading their territory during breeding, the better.</p>
<p>Then, on to Maine, and <a href="http://www.boldcoast.com/msi.htm">Machias Seal Island</a>!  I got the last available ticket for the whole month, for June 19. I am so so SO pumped about this, but sad because I booked so late that I couldn&#8217;t get three tickets for a weekend so Katie and Michael could come, too. Oh, dear&#8211;I&#8217;ll just have to head out there again next year!</p>
<p>Now that all this is plotted out, I need to start making plans to get to Arizona, Big Bend (and maybe out to Golden-cheeked Warbler habitat as well), California, and Washington, and points in between here and there. I may need a trip to South Florida, too. The spirit is willing; the wallet is weak. But we&#8217;ll see! I&#8217;m up to 427, hoping against hope to make it to 600. So I&#8217;m 71 percent of the way there. I&#8217;ll easily get well above 500 this year with just a couple more trips. But 600?! Those final birds are going to be darned tricky.</p>
